# ECCC Women
The Eastern Conference takes special pride in all of its many women racers and its robust, friendly atmosphere for both veterans and newbies. Historically the conference has maintained a comparatively high percentage of women for competitive cycling, and puts significant effort and attention toward maintaining and growing its women's program.

Every ECCC weekend has racing opportunities for participants of all genders, in the same day.
For the most part, there are separate races in the schedule for women, men, and non-binary participants.

All of the material and [[Racer's Guide|introductory guides]] on this website apply to all participants.
This page provides a central location to welcome new women riders,
