# Governing Bodies and Rules
Every cycling event has rules and policies. Riders are expected to follow all rules and policies that are set by the organizers of the event.

The rules set by the Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference fall into two categories:

- **Additional Expectations:**  
  Some rules and policies, such as the Code of Conduct, set standards of conduct and expectations of participants, spectators, coaches,
  and all other members of our community.  
  Regardless of the governing body and rules of any event, ECCC participants are held to all additional expectations set by the conference
  at any conference event, any team gathering, conference and team social media, and any other conference space.  
  Violations of conference expectations may overlap with event policies and regulations - violations may be addressed by the event,
  by referral to governing bodies or SafeSport, and by conference leadership.
- **Conference Specific Modifications:**
  Some conference rules and policies define or modify existing rules, such as setting specific license upgrade requirements for conference members. USA Cycling permits the conference to set conference specific rules[^conference-rules].

  Conference specific modifications must co-exist with the rules of each event. Conference rules will apply when possible,
  but events (especially ones not sanctioned by USA Cycling) may have conflicting rules or not honor the rules and policies set by the conference. If conflicts arise, the rules of the event supersede conference policies, unless the event honors the conference specific rules.

## USA Cycling Policies

Almost all conference events are held under a [USA Cycling][] event permit.
Therefore, at most conference events, the [USA Cycling Rulebook][], including all additional rules, policies, and regulations
(including the [USA Cycling Collegiate Policy Document][]) apply.
