# Mountain Season (MTB)
The ECCC hosts a 4-5 week mountain bike racing season during the early fall semester each school year, with a series of collegiate races hosted by the [[About|Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference]] in partnership with collegiate teams.

Each race weekend typically includes two endurance events, two gravity events, and a team-relay race.
