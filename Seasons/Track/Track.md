## History
The Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference has not held a track season since 2016[^2016-calendar], due to dwindling participation and increasing costs at the time.

### Prior to 2016
Until 2016, the Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference organized a track season every summer, from June to September. See the 2016/2017 calendar[^2016-calendar] for an example schedule.

### 2022+ Talks of Revival
Starting in 2022, some track opportunities and interest has been growing, with some talks of reviving a track season.

Please [[Contact|contact]] conference leadership if you are interested in a track season, and especially if you could contribute time and energy to planning a revived track season.
