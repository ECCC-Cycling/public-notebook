### GoDaddy Website (2019-Oct 2023)
Due to instability at USA Cycling, recent incorporation as a non-profit (and potentially knowing issues sharing collegiatecycling.org??), it was decided ([[Alan Atwood]], [[Kolie Moore]], [[Flyyn Leonard]]) that it would be best to have a website primarily branded as, and fully controlled by the conference.

For speed, ease of a visual editor, and free price, it was decided (same people) that it would be easiest for [[Alan Atwood]] to create a site via the GoDaddy website editor, from the same company that the eccc-cycling.com domain was purchased from. The GoDaddy site was solely edited and maintained by [[Alan Atwood]], due to both limitations in GoDaddy, along with Alan's tireless and great editing.

The majority of website content from the collegiatecycling.org website was copied over and reformatted, including the entire archive of past races.

### Google Site (Oct 2023-)
After several years of using GoDaddy, some limitations were found - most importantly, there wasn't an easy (or free?) way that multiple people could edit the website.

In 2023, the ECCC obtained a free license for Google Workspace (due to non-profit status) and it was decided that Google Sites might offer a similar experience to the GoDaddy site editor, and would allow multiple people access to update content. [[Alan Atwood]] copied the majority of content and reformatted content to work well in Google, and was the first webmaster. About a year into having the Google Site, [[Flyyn Leonard]] wound up being the primary person contributing to and updating the website.

Notably, the full archive of past seasons was never moved to the Google Website.
