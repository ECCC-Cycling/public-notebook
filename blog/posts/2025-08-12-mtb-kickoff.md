# Mountain 2025 Kickoff Meeting, Request for Volunteers

Hi all mountain bikers, [[Mountain 2025]] is around the corner! Check out the [[Mountain 2025#Mountain 2025 Calendar|season schedule]] that was [[2025-08-12-mtb-schedule|announced last month]], and then come chat about logistics and more season details on Wednesday, August 20, 2025, at 7:30pm EST. A link will be posted on Discord and Instagram closer to the meeting.

We also need more help this season, including potentially hiring coaches for intro clinics!
<!-- more -->
Our team is smaller than years past, and our ambitions for this season are even bigger, so we could use a variety of hands, including people who can help time, people who can help organize the event, and potentially people who can help run intro clinics- something we'd love to add this year!

We're looking for people who could dedicate part or all of their day to helping out. If you or someone you know might be interested, please email [mtb@eccc-cycling.com](mailto:mtb@eccc-cycling.com)
