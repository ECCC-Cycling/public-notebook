# Mountain 2025 Kickoff Meeting
Our mountain team ([[Flyyn Leonard]] and [[Luke Knisley]]) led a meeting to kick-off the [[Mountain 2025]] season, with a variety of updates and announcements, including:

- Rotating XC Waves
- Formally adding "pre-qualifier" rounds for dual slalom (when staffed sufficiently)
- Homemade number plates are officially "retired", all riders must use official number plates. (Replacements are $5)
- Updated deadline for team registration spreadsheets (Wednesdays at 5pm EST)
- MTB Intro Clinics

New scholastic riders are encouraged to check with their teams regarding logistics and packing, and recent packing lists posted by [[Northeastern University|Northeastern Cycling]] and [[University of Vermont|UVM Cycling]] were shared in the meeting.

Participants were also reminded that the ECCC is short-staffed this season, and is both looking for help and patience.

Teams who are looking to register via team spreadsheet should email the ECCC (mtb@eccc-cycling.com) to request a copy of this year's spreadsheet - please mention if multiple people should be sent the template, and which weeks you would like a registration spreadsheet for. Teams should immediately email our treasurer & MTB coordination team if they need to put funds in their account.

## New Updates for 2025
### Rotating XC Waves
For equality, the Men's A (et al.) and Women's A (et al.) waves will alternate starting first each week.

At [[2025 UVM Bermie Senders|UVM]], the Men's A and Men's B wave will race **first** at 8:30am. The Women's A (et al.) wave will race **second**, at 10:30am. At the next race ([[2025 Wild Western MA Shred-Fest|Western MA]]), the fields will be swapped back, and so-on.

This decision was made after several discussions were had during the [[Mountain 2024|2024]] season, indicating this was the best option for all of our A riders to have equal chances to preview the race and have a chance to be rested before their race.

### Pre-Qualifier Rounds for Dual Slalom
Our event schedules will officially include optional qualification options for dual slalom, during the morning practice time. These "pre-qualifiers" were added during most dual slalom races in 2024, but we will be making them more formal.

As in 2024, all riders will have **one** qualifying run, with all competitors in the same field qualifying on the same side of the course. Traditionally all qualifying runs were after the dual slalom meeting, but this caused races to run very late. To fix this, riders **optionally** can set a qualifying time during the practice time, if they have had sufficient practice time and feel ready to race. Practice will be interrupted at times to allow riders to set qualifying times, and then will return to practice.

### New Deadline for Spreadsheet Registrations
Teams who wish to register via spreadsheet must **email** spreadsheets to the ECCC ([mtb@eccc-cycling.com](mailto:mtb@eccc-cycling.com)) by **Wednesday at 5pm EST**. This additional time is critical for the ECCC staff to process all registrations (and warn riders who are in the wrong category or are missing waivers).

## MTB Intro Clinics
We are proud to announce that some of our events this season will include intro clinics and races! [[Maris Raisch]] from [[Rochester Institute of Technology|RIT Cycling]] is an experienced coach who will lead clinics for riders new to racing, giving tips on riding and racing, and ensuring participants are familiar with race rules and procedures.

Following the clinic, there will be intro races added to the schedule, allowing new racers to have a smaller field with other novice riders for their first race. Some intro races may be shortened compared to the other fields.

## New Faces
Along with [[Maris Raisch]] who will be helping with our coaching and intro program, [[Alex Rishty]] is joining our team, with a focus on helping our registration and results processing go smoothly.
Welcome to the team!
## Contacting Us
We are asking all participants (and any other interested parties) to **only** contact us via either the ECCC Discord (in `#general` or `#mtb-chat`) or via group email. [mtb@eccc-cycling.com](mailto:mtb@eccc-cycling.com) for most season topics, [upgrades@eccc-cycling.com](mailto:upgrades@eccc-cycling.com) for upgrade-related questions, and [leadership@eccc-cycling.com](mailto:leadership@eccc-cycling.com) for things that aren't season related. (Or any of the other email addresses listed on the [[Contact]] page)

Please avoid emailing any of us directly unless absolutely required.

Our team is stretched very thin - Flyyn is working 12-hour shifts on an ambulance during the week, and Luke is working and traveling internationally. By sending questions and concerns to the group email, it allows whoever is available first to respond, and keeps us all in the loop.
