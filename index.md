# Welcome
The Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference (ECCC) promotes, organizes, and supports
collegiate cycling racing across the Greater New England region.

The ECCC is one of the eleven regional conferences that participate in the
[USA Cycling Collegiate Program](https://usacycling.org/college),
allowing the top college riders to compete in the Collegiate National Championship races each year.

The ECCC covers Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, and Connecticut, including a thousand student athletes from 50+ schools,
competing in track, mountain bike, cyclocross, and road racing events throughout the year.

As a collegiate conference, the ECCC focuses on providing inclusive, supportive, and welcoming
scholastic racing opportunities for college and high school students.
Many conference events also have opportunities for non-scholastic athletes to compete as well.
